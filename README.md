# GAN

Github repo for exploring GANs: How they're made, how to make better ones, and how to use them in production.

## Basic GANs
- Generative Adversarial Networks are made by combining two neural networks:
    - The Generator (Forger) - The network that tries to generate whatever your goal is
    - The Discriminator (Art Critic) - The network that tries to detect fakes
- Generate whatever images you'd like, the network showcased here generates hand-written digits because it trains on the MNIST dataset.
- Deepen your networks with extra convolutions and better loss to generate better and sharper faster.
